This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm on the Iris dataset to predict flower species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is normalized using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations. Multiple K values (1â€“10) are tested to find the optimal K that maximizes accuracy, and model performance is evaluated using accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices. Additionally, decision boundaries are visualized for the first two features to illustrate how KNN classifies data points. Results show high classification accuracy with the optimal K, demonstrating the effectiveness of KNN on well-separated classes. Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
